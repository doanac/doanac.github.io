<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

<p>I'm a software engineer living in Austin, TX. After spending the first 10 years
of my career at IBM, I've been able to focus most of my professional work on
open source projects related to Linux.</p>
<p>I'm known on the internet at places like <a class="reference external" href="http://launchpad.net/~doanac">Launchpad</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/doanac">Github</a> and IRC as
&quot;doanac&quot;. I have my full <a class="reference external" href="resume.html">resume here</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="work">
<h1>Work</h1>
<p>Overall I'm pretty passionate about Linux and have been lucky enough to have
worked on embedded Linux projects since 2006. Starting in 2011 with my job
<a class="reference external" href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://linaro.org">Linaro</a>, I've worked almost exclusively on open source
projects.</p>
<p>Some of my more notable contributions include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Was once mistakenly assigned as as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/linux-kernel-developer-thomas-gleixner/">Thomas Gleixner</a>'s mentor. I cleared
things up with him and HR, but its still technically the most prestigious
title I've ever held.</li>
<li>Wrote substantial parts of Linaro's Automated Validation Architecture (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.linaro.org/initiatives/lava/">LAVA</a>)
in the early days. This is used for doing testing on embedded devices for
many people in the industry. Its also now a driver in the <a class="reference external" href="https://kernelci.org/">KernelCI</a> project.</li>
<li>Architected the <a class="reference external" href="https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-test-case-dev/ubuntu-test-cases/touch">CI system</a> used for the development of the Ubuntu Phone.</li>
<li>Updated Linaro's Git server, git.linaro.org, to have servers around the world
serving &quot;read requests&quot; to users based on their location. This gave people
is some remote locations a 400% performance improvement and made the system
highly-available for read operations.</li>
<li>Upstreamed a REST API into the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork">Patchwork</a> project and helped review the
patches for &quot;series support&quot;. Patchwork is an important tool to many key
kernel maintainers for managing their incoming reviews. Its also used by
Linaro to help understand what areas such a large organization is actually
<a class="reference external" href="http://patches.linaro.org/">working on</a>.</li>
<li>Created the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.linaro.org/leg/sdi/openstack-ref-architecture.git/">reference architecture</a> for deploying one of the world's first
OpenStack deployments on ARM hardware. This turned into the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linaro.cloud/">Linaro Cloud</a>.</li>
<li>After years of struggling with CI systems that didn't work, I created
a small but really powerful system called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/foundriesio/jobserv/">JobServ</a> that drives CI
for <a class="reference external" href="https://foundries.io/">Foundries.io</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><em>Can he work with others?</em> - My REST API work with Patchwork is a decent example
of starting with a <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/patchwork/2016-April/002694.html">simple idea</a> and seeing it through to <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/patchwork/2016-June/002961.html">completion</a>. My
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/issues/1056">aktualizr-lite</a> project is also a good example of getting another team
to accept potentially controversial changes.</p>
<p><em>Can he articulate what he does?</em> - My <a class="reference external" href="https://foundries.io/insights/2018/07/12/ota-part-4/">blog series</a> on secure over the
air updates is an example.</p>
<p><em>Can he really code?</em> - The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/foundriesio/jobserv/">JobServ</a> code base is decent proof.</p>
<p><em>What about C++?</em> - I did a bunch pre C++11, so I consider myself a bit rusty.
However, I've been making some drive-by contributions to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adoanac">aktualizr</a> recently
that show a bit of my work.</p>
<p><em>What about Golang?</em> - I'd really like to start doing more with Golang. Here's
an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/foundriesio/tuftree/">early prototype</a> of what became aktualizr-lite.</p>
<p><em>Kubernetes?</em> - Most is closed-source, but here are some contributions to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/advancedtelematic/ota-community-edition/pulls?&amp;q=+is%3Apr+author%3Adoanac">OTA Community Edition</a>.</p>
<p><em>Shell Scripts?</em> - That's a trick question because nobody would ever brag
on shell scripts, right? Still - I once made changes to a 10,000 line
single file installer written in Korn. I fear no code base.</p>
