<h1>Foundries.io <em>Oct 2017 - Present</em></h1>
<p><strong>Senior Engineer</strong></p>
<p>Created a small company with 8 people from Linaro. I am the owner of the
Continuous Integration and Device Management products and all other
back-end services for the company. This lead me to create <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/foundriesio/jobserv">JobServ</a>,
a highly available and scalable open source CI engine. I also created
a couple dozen Kubernetes deployments running in Google's Kubernetes Engine.
Other notable accomplishments include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Contributing to several components of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/advancedtelematic/ota-community-edition">OTA Connect</a> project as well as
creating <a class="reference external" href="https://foundries.io/insights/2018/08/09/ota-api/">blog series</a> on making production deployments into GKE.</li>
<li>Creating a multi-architecture enabled <a class="reference external" href="https://hub.foundries.io">Docker registry</a> with Notary
enabled detailed version-to-version vulnerability scans and changelogs.</li>
<li>Developed some novel new ways to do bare-metal testing for embedded
Linux devices as well as Zephy-class microcontrollers.</li>
<li>Contributing both Docker App and &quot;aktualizr-lite&quot; support to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/advancedtelematic/aktualizr/">Aktualizr</a> project.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="linaro-2013-2017">
<h1>Linaro <em>2013 - 2017</em></h1>
<p><strong>Senior Engineer</strong></p>
<p>Ran a small team of three engineers reporting to the Director of Engineering. The
team was tasked with developing and maintaining all of Linaro's internal
tooling such as Jenkins, Git and Gerrit. Notable accomplishments include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added Python bindings and a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jackmitch/libsoc/tree/master/contrib/board_files">board-probing</a> mechanism for
determining GPIO pin mappings at runtime to libsoc.</li>
<li>Updating Linaro's Git service, git.linaro.org, to be high-available and
horizontally scalable.</li>
<li>Upstreaming a REST API into the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork">Patchwork</a> project and helped review the
patches for &quot;series support&quot;. Patchwork is an important tool to many key
kernel maintainers for managing their incoming reviews. Its also used by
Linaro to help understand what areas such a large organization is actually
<a class="reference external" href="http://patches.linaro.org/">working on</a>.</li>
<li>Creating the <a class="reference external" href="https://git.linaro.org/leg/sdi/openstack-ref-architecture.git/">reference architecture</a> for deploying one of the world's first
OpenStack deployments on ARM hardware. This turned into the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linaro.cloud/">Linaro Cloud</a>.</li>
